## Overview

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed, production-ready environment for running containerized applications. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Google Kubernetes Engine metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.stackdriver** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

  

#### Configuring Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
 GCP project

 

##### Set relevant credentials in GCP

1. Navigate to the [Project selector](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create) and choose the project to send metrics from.
2. In the **Service account details** screen, give the service account a unique name and select **Create and continue**.
3. In the **Grant this service account access to project** screen, add the following roles: Compute Viewer, Monitoring Viewer, and Cloud Asset Viewer.
4. Select **Done**.
5. Select your project in the **Service accounts for project** list.
6. Select **KEYS**.
7. Select **Keys > Add Key > Create new key** and choose JSON as the type.
8. Select **Create and Save**.

:::note
You must be a Service Account Key Admin to select Compute Engine and Cloud Asset roles.

##### Add an environment variable for the key

On your machine, run:

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<<PATH-TO-YOUR-GCP-KEY>>
```

Replace `<<PATH-TO-YOUR-GCP-KEY>>` with the path to the JSON file created in the previous step.


##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 on a dedicated machine

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

##### Add the inputs.stackdriver plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the GCP data from your hosts. To do this, add the below code to the configuration file. 

``` ini
[[inputs.stackdriver]]

  project = "<<YOUR-PROJECT>>"

  metric_type_prefix_include = [
    "kubernetes.io",
  ]

  interval = "1m"
```

* Replace `<<YOUR-PROJECT>>` with the name of your GCP project.

:::note
The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/stackdriver/README.md)
:::
 

If you need to restrict the number of metrics you receive, adjust the `metric_type_prefix_include` URL to your scope, e.g. `kubernetes.io/anthos/APIService`. For more information on the metric types, see [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics).

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in
  
{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

##### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}  
  
##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
